        <span>The Great Houses</span>
        <p>The Great Houses are the most powerful of the noble houses of the Seven Kingdoms. They exercise immense authority and power over their vassals and territories and are answerable only to the King of the Andals and the First Men, with the exception of House Stark, which rules over an independent kingdom.</p>
